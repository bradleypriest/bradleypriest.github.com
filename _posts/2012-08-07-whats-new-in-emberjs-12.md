Big News: Last week saw the release of Ember 1.0.pre, check out the [release post](http://emberjs.com/blog/2012/08/03/ember-1-0-prerelease/) and download your copy [here](https://github.com/downloads/emberjs/ember.js/ember-1.0.pre.js).

This is a huge step forward, no longer do you have to toss up whether to recommend the defunct 0.9.8 or wildly changing bleeding edge when introducing ALL of your friends to Ember.

N.B. There was a small bug with the 1.0.pre release which has since been [fixed](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/commit/f1ec52aaa0713c7edeca237d38f172e0671a4c0e).

###Weekly Wrapup #12

#### Updates

* [http://docs.emberjs.com/](http://docs.emberjs.com/) has been updated to 1.0.pre documentation, no more building your own local copy. There is also work being done currently to get an edge docs site up, you can find a copy at [http://ember-edge-docs.herokuapp.com](http://ember-edge-docs.herokuapp.com/) whilst they sort out a proper domain.

* [ember-rails](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails) and the [starter-kit](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit) have been updated to 1.0.pre hopefully this should fix a lot of issues with getting started with ember.

* For all you pythonistas out there, there is now a [django-ember](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-ember/0.1) package available.

Sorry, not too many code updates this week, but if you really want to get your hands dirty, check out the [relationship-improvements](https://github.com/emberjs/data/tree/relationship-improvements) WIP branch of ember-data.

If I missed anything please let me know in the comments, twitter or IRC at #emberjs.
