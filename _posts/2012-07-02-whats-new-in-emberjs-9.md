Pretty quiet this week sorry

###Weekly Wrapup #9

#### Improvements

* ember-data [now](https://github.com/emberjs/data/commit/3847ed317714556b834198bce60aefbd31fa83e3) no longer sets the `isDirty` flag if the value hasn't changed.

* [9d8247](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/commit/9d82473d7a543ea2e2b7b6d24dc2486aff7703c1) fixes the router to always call `connectOutlets` of intermediate routes when using the router.

* The router has also had a couple more tweaks to handle initialStates better.
