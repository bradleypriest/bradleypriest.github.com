It's a bit of a clich√© these days, but it still makes a helluva lot of sense. **Just (f\*\*king) do it.**

I've been living in Auckland for a few years now, have a comfortable job at a respectable company, a great group of friends.
Some people would say I'm pretty settled, I personally would use the word complacent.

So when a few weeks ago the opportunity came to throw myself way out of my comfort zone, I was all for it. **Just (f\*\*king) do it.**

So, as of Friday I quit my job, gave notice on my apartment and am on my way to Singapore to work on [TradeGecko](http://tradegecko.com) an exciting new startup with my brother Cameron and his business partner Carl.

I'm sure you'll hear more about it from me over the coming few months, we've got 40 days left in the [JFDI](http://jfdi.asia) incubator and quite a prototype to put together. I am so excited right now.

If you're not completely happy with where you're at or there's something else you're considering. **Just (f\*\*king) do it.** You only have one life. Make the most of it.
